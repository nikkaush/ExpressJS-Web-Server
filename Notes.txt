ExpressJS - Notes

Code referred from 
https://github.com/robertbunch/justExpress

HTTP is based on TCP

To run s JS file from cmd
node filename.js


socket.io

Express is a node module
node can live without express but express can't live without node

Before Express
	HTTP
	TCP/UDP
	NodeJS Web server (without Express)
		why express
		
	
	Packet
	
	Application layer		HTTP/FTP/SSH/SMTP
	Transport layer			UDP/TCP			TCP/IP layer
	Network layer			IP
	Link layer				wifi, eht
	Physical layer			actual cable
	
	
	Express only handles http requests, and it uses TCP
	
	Transport layer creates 65000 ports on the computer 
	
	Segment(destination_port, source_port)
	
	UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		lightweight (8 bytes)
		connectionless
		consistency (it will always keep sending the data)
			send data no matter what
				does not care about packet loss
				does not care about network congestion
				does not care abou packet order
		un-reliable
		
	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
		connection based (uses 3 way handshake)
		reliable
		delivery acknowledgement
		re-transmission of data
		in-order packets
		congestion control
		
	HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol)
		http://info.cern.ch/
		efficient
		http is only connected when required
		stateless (as http connection is terminated, the state is lost)
		
		start line		get /blob http/1.1
		header		metadata (key-value)
		body
		
		
		
nodemon -> hot reloding (just like webpack)
nodemon vs webpack??

npm install -g nodemon
nodemon filename.js


NodeJS is written in C. It runs javascript. Just like chrome's v8 engine.
A web-framework for NodeJS
